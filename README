The Audio File Library handles reading and writing audio files in many
common formats.

Key goals of the Audio File Library are file format transparency and data
format transparency. The same calls for opening a file, accessing and
manipulating audio metadata (e.g. sample rate, sample format, textual
information, MIDI parameters), and reading and writing sample data will
work with any supported audio file format. Likewise, the format of the
audio data presented to the application need not be tied to the format
of the data contained in the file.

The following file formats are currently supported:
* AIFF/AIFF-C
* WAVE
* NeXT .snd/Sun .au
* Berkeley/IRCAM/CARL Sound File
* Audio Visual Research
* Amiga IFF/8SVX
* Sample Vision
* Creative Voice File
* NIST SPHERE
* Core Audio Format
* FLAC

The following compression formats are currently supported:
* G.711 mu-law and A-law
* IMA ADPCM
* Microsoft ADPCM
* FLAC
