----

The Audio File Library provides a uniform programming interface to
standard digital audio file formats.

This library allows the processing of audio data to and from audio
files of many common formats (currently AIFF, AIFF-C, WAVE, NeXT/Sun
.snd/.au, and IRCAM).  The library also supports compression (currently
G.711 mu-law and A-law and IMA and MS ADPCM) as well as PCM formats of
all flavors (signed and unsigned integer, floating point and
double-precision floating point).

One premise of the Audio File Library is that the data presented to
an application need not be in the same format as the data contained in
the file.  Another, however, is that the capabilities of the file format
are exposed to the application programmer should the programmer wish to
take advantage of them.

The Audio File Library itself is available under the GNU Library General
Public License, and the programs in this package are available under
the GNU General Public License.  The two licenses are included in the
files COPYING and COPYING.GPL, respectively.
