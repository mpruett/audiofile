Audio File Library Development Notes

----

The Audio File Library supports CCITT G.711 mu-law and A-law
compression.  Many compressed data formats are not supported.  This is
currently the most important issue to address.

Error handling is at the present quite robust, but more work can always
be done in this area.

SGI's Audio File Library on IRIX implements the following formats which
this version of the library does not:

	MPEG1 audio bitstream
	Sound Designer II
	Audio Visual Research
	Amiga IFF/8SVX
	SampleVision
	VOC
	SoundFont2

I plan to implement some of these as time permits.  Sound Designer
II is out of the question because of its dependency upon Macintosh
resource forks.  Handling these files on Unix systems is simply not
worth the effort.

This version of the Audio File Library has been tested under the
following operating environments:

	mips-sgi-irix6.5 / IRIX 6.5 (gcc 2.8.1)
	mips-sgi-irix6.5 / IRIX 6.5 (MIPSpro cc 7.3.1.2m)
	mips-sgi-irix6.5 / IRIX 6.5 (MIPSpro cc 7.2.1.3m)
	i686-pc-linux-gnu / Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (gcc 2.95.2)
	i686-pc-linux-gnu / Red Hat Linux 7.1 (gcc 2.96)
	i686-pc-linux-gnu / Red Hat Linux 6.1 (egcs 1.1.2)
	i386-unknown-netbsd1.3 / NetBSD 1.3 (gcc 2.7.2.2+myc1)
	ia64-sgi-linux / Turbolinux IA64 Beta 3 (gcc 2.96-ia64-000717)
	ia64-sgi-linux / Turbolinux IA64 Beta 3 (SGI Pro64 cc 0.01.0-13)

The version of GNU cc shipped with some versions of Red Hat 7.0 [1] is
known to fail on an internal compiler error while compiling some of the
test programs:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../libaudiofile -g -O2 -c twentyfour.c
twentyfour.c: In function `main':
twentyfour.c:231: Internal error: Floating point exception.

Updated versions of GNU cc available from Red Hat fix this problem.
This problem is not present in Red Hat 7.1 [2].

[1] On a Red Hat 7.0 system, gcc has the following version information:
% gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.96/specs
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)

[2] On a Red Hat 7.1 system, gcc has the following version information:
% gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.96/specs
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81)
