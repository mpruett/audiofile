Audio File Library 0.2.1
Michael Pruett <mpruett@sgi.com / michael@68k.org>

Short-term:
Sample rate conversion needs to be handled.

Longer-term:
(These will hopefully be resolved by version 0.3.)

Add locale support for error messages.

Documentation should probably be in the SGML DocBook format.

More compressed data formats need to be handled.

More comprehensive tests should be developed to stress-test the
library.

Thread-safe error handling would be nice.

Whenever a compression format is requested, the library should scan
through /usr/lib/audiofile/*.so to see if any DSOs support the requested
format.
